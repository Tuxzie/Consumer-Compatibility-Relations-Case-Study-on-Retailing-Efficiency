# Consumer-Compatibility-Relations-Case-Study-on-Retailing-Efficiency
Consumers often enter stores with a general understanding of what they want, but never what exactly they need. This project aims to dig deeper into building relations via compatbility, value (via performance vs. dollar), and how 
we can help associates or consumers help one another navigate current systems more effectively.

Suppose: 
Person_A wants random access memory (RAM) at a hardware store -> Person_A sees RAM of different speeds (MHz), generations (DDR4/DDR5), storage (2x16GB, 2x32GB, etc.), and price points ($X, $Y). 

That's a lot of work for the consumer, the retail associate needs to ask many questions (e.g., "What do you use it for?", "Are you looking for dollar value?", etc.). Let's see if we can make everyone's life easier.
